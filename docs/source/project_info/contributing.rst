Write Documentation
===================
DEIMoS could always use more documentation, or have existing documentation improved upon.

Please reference the documentation guidelines below.
Changes to documentation should be submitted as pull requests.

-------------------------
Submitting a Pull Request
-------------------------

To update the documentation, fix bugs or add new features you need to create a pull request.
Any changes you make to your local copy of the code will be made easily available for review and eventual integration into the code base.
To create a pull request:

#. Create a GitHub account
#. Fork the repository
#. Clone your fork locally
#. Go to the created deimos folder with :code:`cd deimos`
#. Create a new branch with :code:`git checkout -b <descriptive_branch_name>`
#. Make your changes to the code or documentation
#. Run :code:`git add -A` to add all the changed files to the commit
#. To commit the added files, run :code:`git commit -m '<text>'` or :code:`git commit`. The latter will open a command line editor to write a commit message. Commit messages should have a descriptive line header (<50 characters, including spaces), followed by an empty line, and then a description of what you did and why. We also ask that the header be of the style "This commit will <commit message>", with the first letter capitalized and no trailing period. Please see existing commit history for examples.
#. Push your changes to your deimos fork by running :code:`git push origin <descriptive_branch_name>`
#. If you then navigate to the webpage for your deimos fork, you should see a "Pull request" link in the sidebar. Choose the relevant pull request from the menu and click the "Create Pull Request" button. Ensure the pull request target branch is <descriptive_branch_name>!

If you want to create more pull requests, first run :code:`git checkout main` and then start at step 5 with a new branch name.
